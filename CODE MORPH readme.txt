CODE MORPH

Legacy code migration is a critical yet challenging task in modern software development, requiring extensive manual effort to analyze, restructure, and rewrite outdated systems. CodeMorph is an AI-driven web application that automates and optimizes the process of modernizing outdated codebases. Leveraging a multi-agent AI architecture, CodeMorph streamlines the transformation of legacy systems into scalable, efficient, and maintainable modern applications.

The system consists of five specialized AI agents working collaboratively:

Strategist Agent – Reviews legacy code and devises an optimized migration strategy.
Fragmentation Agent – Breaks down the old code into logical components for better analysis.
Migrator Agent – Generates modernized code using AI-driven transformation techniques.
Testing & Review Agent – Executes test cases on the new code, validates correctness, and suggests improvements.
Documentor Agent – Generates comprehensive documentation, highlighting key changes and improvements.

Each stage incorporates human oversight where necessary, ensuring a balance between automation and expert validation. CodeMorph enhances software longevity, reduces technical debt, and accelerates modernization processes for enterprises and developers.

This innovative system paves the way for seamless and intelligent legacy code transformation, leveraging the power of multi-agent AI architecture to create scalable, reliable, and future-proof software solutions.
